# 🔥 Multi-Chain Crypto Drainer

BitBleeder is the most advanced drainer on the market. It supports over 13 networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum One, Optimism, Base, Avalanche C-Chain, Zksync Era, Scroll, Fantom Opera, Cronos, Mantle, Blast, Linea, Moonbeam, Celo, Gnosis Chain, Klaytn, Astar, Opbnb, Metis, Boba Network, Mode, Taiko, Harmony Shard 0, Aurora, Evmos, Okx Chain, Kava EVM, Rootstock, Shiden, Zora, Palm, Fuse, Moonriver, KCC, Chiliz Chain, Core Blockchain, Canto, Dogechain, Telos EVM, Lukso, SX Network, Taraxa, Rollux, Darwinia Network, Crab Network, Endurance Smart Chain, Shardeum Sphinx Validator 1.X, and Etherlink. The search for assets in users' wallets is performed using a reliable DeBank provider, though it can be replaced with Ankr, Zapper, or OpenSea via the settings if desired. The drainer efficiently identifies and withdraws the wallet’s main coin, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs in fully automatic mode.

To install the script, deploying your own smart contracts or ensuring they are flagged as phishing is unnecessary. The script can operate without smart contracts entirely or with a specialized public contract, eliminating the challenges of creating your own contract, paying various fees, and managing connections. This contract is highly flexible and supports multiple event types that can be triggered on your site, such as Security Update, Claim, Claim Reward, Execute, Connect, Swap, Permit, Permit V2, Uniswap, Pancakeswap, and Seaport V1.5. Additionally, the script includes six different contracts for self-deployment on the blockchain.

## Principle of Operation

The crypto drainer prioritizes withdrawing the most expensive assets first, followed by the cheapest ones. It builds a smart queue unrestricted by network or resource type. The intelligent settlement system accounts for the resources required to cover network fees, maximizing the amount extracted from the user’s wallet and sent to you. You can also customize priorities in the script—for example, targeting tokens that support PERMIT first or those withdrawable via exchangers.

The script offers multiple withdrawal methods for tokens and NFTs, easily configurable to suit your needs: tokens can be withdrawn via direct transfer, confirmation, PERMIT calls, exchangers, or an inconspicuous signature. Depending on the user’s chosen wallet, the most suitable method is automatically selected, with the default being the most discreet and effective option. For NFTs, the script can approve an entire collection at once, allowing all items to be withdrawn with a single signature.

Automatic withdrawal of approved assets is supported: once the user confirms, signs Permit V2, or grants access to an entire NFT collection, the script independently withdraws these assets and transfers them to your wallet without requiring your intervention, provided it’s technically feasible. For this feature to work correctly, the drainer’s wallet must always hold some coins.

After draining coins like USDT, USDC, and many others, the drainer secures an "Approve" permission for an infinite amount and duration. As soon as the user replenishes their wallet with these tokens again, they are automatically transferred to your wallet.

The script supports over 300 wallets and offers two connection methods: native and WalletConnect. Native wallets integrate directly with the drainer and include MetaMask, Coinbase, Binance Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Other wallets can connect via WalletConnect by scanning a QR code from a mobile device or by opening the site on a phone and selecting a wallet from the installed options. Most mobile wallets support WalletConnect, and the script is compatible with both versions of the protocol.

## What methods are used when draining assets?

The script offers several customizable methods for withdrawing tokens and NFTs, tailored to your needs:

- ⭐ **Direct Transfer**: Tokens are sent straight from the user’s wallet.
- ⭐ **Confirmation**: Withdrawal occurs after user approval.
- ⭐ **PERMITv2 Call**: Tokens are withdrawn using the PERMITv2 function.
- ⭐ **Exchangers**: Assets are routed through exchange services.
- ⭐ **Inconspicuous Signature**: A discreet signature method is used.

The script selects the most suitable method based on the user’s chosen wallet, defaulting to the most inconspicuous and effective option. For NFTs, it can approve an entire collection at once, allowing all items to be withdrawn with a single signature.

## Automatic Withdrawal of Approved Assets

Once the user confirms, signs a Permit V2, or grants access to an entire NFT collection, the script—if technically feasible—automatically withdraws these assets and transfers them to your wallet without requiring your intervention. For this feature to function properly, the drainer’s wallet must always hold some coins.

## Infinite Approval Mechanism

After draining tokens like USDT, USDC, and others, the drainer secures an "Approve" permission for an infinite amount and duration. Whenever the user replenishes their wallet with these tokens, they are automatically transferred to your wallet.
